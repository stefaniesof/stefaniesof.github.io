	<h3>A procurement process workflow across whole government agency.</h3>

		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>The client wanted to bring in user-centric design thinking onto their product after they had build a working prototype. The product is built on a form-builder platform, which has many constrains on the interface & functionality. My role here was to access their form experiences, structure, and standardise UI component & terminology to maximise "user-friendliness" in the midst of technical constraint condition.</p>
		<h4>Goal</h4>
		<p>Asure the usability & user-friendliness of the form.
		<br>Eliminate time-consuming matter in filling out online form.</p>

		<h2>Approach</h2>

		<h4>1. Understanding Functionality & Procedures</h4>
		<p>From the product that has been built, first I started by understanding the context and the intent of the product by playing around with the screen and asking questions for validation to the Product Owner.</p>

		<h4>2. Understanding Users & Roles</h4>

		<h4>3. Evaluation & Suggestion</h4>
		<p>Using common design principles when evaluating the screen's interaction.
		<br>- Compression of fields (remove as many fields possible)
		<br>- Autofill
		<br>- Contrast in highlighting mandatory fields to avoid encounter error
		<br>- Clear instructions
		<br>- Clear structure, grouping, and flow. To let user know where they are at.
		<br>- Structure the form, from easy to hard

		<h4>3. Sponsor User Validation</h4>
		<P>To validate what have we evaluate & suggest works for the users.
		<br><b>1. On reducing number of fields</b> seek a view and discussion with the related roles to make sure we only provide fields that is required to make their decision, by understanding each roles' goal.</p>
