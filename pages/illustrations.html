  <h2>Big Bang Pizza</h2>
  <p>Greedy for sense of wonder. A huge pizza with outer space topping is how I portray the wonders in life. Craving for something more than just a fact. Without imagination there's no art and neither science. To see the world like a child again, live up that curiosity wouldn't kill a cat, there just lies an infinite possibilities, a wonder cat might've been discovered. When you stop to wonder is when the world stop revolves. </p>

  <h2>Kopi-O-By-Myself</h2>
  <p>A word play to show an obsession towards the O(All)-Time-Favourite drink of all generations, Coffee. From the young coffee-addicts to auntie and uncles, coffee has become a must-have in their daily lives. Thanks to Eric Carmen's famous song All by Myself to be my inspiration of this illustration.</p>
