		<h2>Background</h2>
		<p>This is my school project back in NAFA. The brief was for Frank OCBC to help youth in their saving habit. It's one of my favorite project. Aside from winning an award surprisingly (Advertising, Silver, Crowbar Award 2015), I think this work speaks for myself as a designer to bring out delightful experience.</p>

		<h4>My role</h4>
		<p>Student</p>

	<h2>The problem & approach</h2>

		<h4>The Problem</h4>
			<p>
			Low rate of saving habit in youth
			</p>

		<h4>Brainstorming</h4>
		<p>
			Always start with the subject when trying to solve a problem, first few attempts came up with all the basic ideas that solve the main problem, but here we need something that engaging and relates with the target audience.
		</p>

		<h4>About target audience</h4>
		<p>
			High spending habit
			<br>Low saving habit
			<br>Spend most of the times in shopping mall or friend's house
			<br>Spend mostly on foods and entertainment
		</p>

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<h4>Insights</h4>
		<p>
			Youngsters just like to have fun, so we're gonna make saving fun too for them.
		</p>

		<h4>Ideas</h4>
		<p>
While spending their money, they left with coins which they don't like to keep. We create a fun place where they can get rid off their coins from the pocket to save it in their bank account.</p>


		<h4>Solution</h4>
		<p>Arcade/Coin-deposit machine</p>
