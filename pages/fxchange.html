In this project they are looking to leverage their audience to those who stay in Singapore and wants to travel out, we are engaged to enhance their business by building a mobile app that helps bring the locals to withdraw foreign currency from FXChange as a solution. Worked directly with stakeholders, the team consisted of myself, lead designer, a project manager, and developers. </p>

	<h2>The approach</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>What to discover</h5>
		<p>
			<li>Business model & strategy
			<li>Consumer's mindset and behaviour in buying foreign currencies

(Focus group) The participants are locals who live in Singapore, working adults and university students, 22-36 years old, travel at least 3 times a year.</h5>
			<p>
				<li>Participants want to travel as less as possible to collect the money.
				<li>Participants want to see clearly on what they pay and what they get asideâ€¨	from the confusing displayed rates.
				<li>Participants want to keep track on the rates day to day.
				<li>Participants want a trusted single point without having to compare.
				<li>Deciding and comparing on where to exchange their money is the most hassle, but an inevitable behavior of most customers.</p>

	<h2>Prototype & validate</h2>
		<p>We quicky prototype a wireframe and validate our idea for the main functions.
First, we introduced users about our machine and how it works.
Second, informed about the feature to lock your currency rates and collect anytime.</p>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Purchasing</h5>
			<p>We learned that users quickly scan through the flag to find their currency. The viewing rate always confuse users and the preferences are vary (between we  buy/we sell), but we realised what matters to them is the converted rate of the amount theyâ€™re buying. As it resolved their confusion when they arrive to the buying page. Locations are a big concern for users too, they wanted to know if the location are convenient for them to collect before making a purchase.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Collection</h5>
			<p>Comments on this that users donâ€™t have a clear view that they had purchase something in the main page. Also, users concern about when QR code doesnâ€™t work and we found that some users canâ€™t locate the machine inside a building. So we decide to provide a collection code to be the alternative and give more detailed location of the machine by guiding pictures.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Iterate & build</h2>
		<p>From the feedbacks and data collected. We iterate the wireframe and come up with final design and pass the assets to the devs. For art direction, we have to explore on how they want to position themselves as thereâ€™s no branding except for the logo. We proposed for a trust and frugal tone of voice, which made use of their dark blue and gold color to show the essence of our product.</p>
