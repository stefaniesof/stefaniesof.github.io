		<h2>Validate our assumptions: Potential User Interview</h2>
<h4>The participants are 5 locals who live in Singapore, working adults and university students, 22-36 years old, travel at least 3 times a year.</h4>
			<h4>What we wish to uncover</h4>
				<p>
				- Overall behaviour or thoughts in money exchange transaction
				<br>- Opinion about the app concept, liking, and concerns</p>
			<h4>Findings</h4>

				<p>How:
				<br>- Participants chose to exchange at their 'usual' money changer or the nearest.
				<br>- Participants exchange money at least few days before the trip date to be safe.
				<br>- 3 out of 5 participants always check online rates and compare.
				<br>Thoughts:
				<br>- Most participants find the currency exchange rates are hard to understand.
				<br>- Most participants would like to avoid exchanging at airport counter, unsatisfying rates.
				<br>- 100% participants like the idea of locking down currency rates anywhere, anytime.
				<br>- Participants will likely to keep track of the currency rates if it's convinient for them.

	<h2>Prototype & validate</h2>
		<p>We quicky prototype a wireframe and validate our idea for the main functions.
And gather feedbacks from usabality testing to iterate.</p>

	<h2>Iterate & build</h2>
		<p>From the feedbacks and data collected. We iterate the wireframe and come up with final design.</p>
	<p><b>1. Currency Selection</b></p>
	<p>To solve the confusion of reading rate, an indication of base currencies in SGD is added.<br>Visual aid in form of country flag to add into clarity.<br>We allow user to select and display only the currency they need.</p>
	<p><b>2. Machine can only dispense specific denominal notes</b></p>
	<p>Show user starting from lowest denominal that can be bought</p>
	<p><b>3. Finding collection point</b></p>
	<p>To better locate the location of the machine, we provide the picture of it's surrounding area</p>

	<h4>Final Design</h4>
	<p>For art direction, we have to explore on how they want to position themselves as there's no branding except for the logo. We proposed for a trust and frugal tone of voice, which made use of their dark blue and gold color to show the essence of our product. Passed assets and flow to developers and we went live.</p>
