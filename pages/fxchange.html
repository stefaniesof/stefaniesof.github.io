	<h2>Iterate & build</h2>
		<p>From the feedbacks and data collected. We iterate the wireframe and come up with final design and pass the assets to the devs. For art direction, we have to explore on how they want to position themselves as thereâ€™s no branding except for the logo. We proposed for a trust and frugal tone of voice, which made use of their dark blue and gold color to show the essence of our product.</p>
