	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Marina Bay Sands has a 5,000-10,000 employeed and currently handing their employeeâ€™s cases manually. This result in time ineffectiveness and disorganized way of work.
		<br>
		The project took 3 months in firming up the requirements and process. The team consisted of myself, a business analyst, a project manager and developers. We worked together with product owner, users, and multiple stakeholders.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>My role</h5>
		<p>User Research, Process Flow, User Journey, Wireframe, Prototype, UI Design.</p>
</div>

<h2>Goal & Problems</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Goal</h5>
			<p>
			Increase the productivty, reliability, and time efficiency in case handling.
			</p>
		<h5>Current Problems</h5>
		<p>
			1. Manual processing with excel and paper sheets, resulting in disorganized way of storing and withdrawing.
<br>
2. Time inefficiency in back-and-forth information passing between one and another (e.g seeking approval)
<br>
3. Lack of reliability and security with current man-handling process.
</p>
	</div>

<h2>Approach</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Sponsored Users Interview (As-Is Process)</h5>
		<p>
			Me and a business analyst condcuted a series of workshops to understand the current process and align everybodyâ€™s ideas into a consensus. Driving the conversation with a framework (roles & stages) that helps to fill in our process map.
		</p>

	<div class="paragraph">
				<h5>Focus Group</h5>
				<p>We gathered key points from our user focus groups. On their tasks, goals, and pain points. Together we brainstormed and synteshize possible features to corporate in the system.

				</p>
				<h5>Key Points</h5>
				<p><b>1. Organisation of data placement</b>
				<br>
				Make it easier to look up on cases that matters to each roles.
				<br>
				<b>2.Â High-level analytics on cases</b>
				<br>
				For the organization to gain insights on therid development.
				<br>
				<b>3. Reminders and Alerts</b>
				<br>
				Cut time inefficiency to avoid delay between roles. 
				<br>
				<b>4. Tracking Activity</b>
				<br>
				To log all activities for security and reliability purpose.
				</p>

	<h2>Design considerations</h2>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>I started with triggers and actions each roles need to do as my guidance  to sketch out the screens as Iâ€™m trying to get one layout that can be used as much throughout the process for every role to retain consistency.
		</p>

		<div class="paragraph">
		<img class="image-page" src="../images/cms-sketch.png">
		<p>The page structured as such to be reused for every role.</p>

	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<img class="image-page" src="../images/cms-allcase.png">
		<h5>All Cases</h5>
		<p>Page where users look up for their cases and check the status.
		</p>
		
		<img class="image-page" src="../images/cms-incident.png">
		<h5>Structure of the main case page</h5>
		<p>See the background of the incident and see multiple cases.
Trigger & record actions for each alleged team member.
And look up on personell that involved in the case (e.g their manager, HR representative, etc.)
		</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>
		We made sure all screens are flown together and created a UI guideline to our developers which helped in cutting down development time.
