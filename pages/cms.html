		<h1>One-Source-For-All Case Management ðŸ•µ</h1>
		<h3>How might we ease and enhance the work in handling cases within a big organization?</h3>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Background</h5>
		<p>Marina Bay Sands has a 5,000-10,000 employeed and currently handing their employeeâ€™s cases manually. This result in time ineffectiveness and disorganized way of work. In this project they are looking to simplify processes and to have one single source to access the cases. The project took 3 months in firming up the requirements and process. The team consisted of myself, a business analyst, a project manager and developers. We worked together with product owner, users, and multiple stakeholders.</p>
	</div>
		<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>My role</h5>
		<p>User Research, Process Flow, User Journey, Wireframe, Prototype, UI Design.</p>
</div>

	<h2>Process</h2>

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Stakeholders Interview</h5>
			<p>
			Started from a high-level scope written by the client. We came in for further requirement gathering with a brief assumption in our head. Me and a business analyst condcuted a series of workshops to understand the current process and align everybodyâ€™s ideas into a consensus. Driving the conversation with a framework (roles & stages) that helps to fill in our process map.

	<div class="paragraph">
		<h5>Focus group</h5>
		<p>
			We organzied a focus group interview and recruited 5 internal staff to identify their feelings, concerns, and needs. We asked questions like:
<li>How do you feel about the current process? Whatâ€™s good and bad?
<li>What would be a better solution?
<li>If we were to digitize, do you have any concerns or thoughts about it?
	<br>
Feedbacks are gathered to iterate the process map and for us to propose the to-be process and kick-start wireframes to test.
</p>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph">
			<h5>Key points to tackle</h5>
			<p>
				<li>Store files in the relevant place, especially for a big case
				<li>High-level analytics on cases
				<li>One case can involve many team members & personell
				<li>There are two type of infractions that leads to different process (serious & performance)
			</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Design considerations</h2>
	<div class="paragraph">
		<p>After firming up the process flow, I listed down all the roles that involved in the system and the high-level task they need to perform to start structuring the layout.
